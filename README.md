## Instruction

First we need to install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`)

```bash
npm install
```

Then we should start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Now visit on browser (in case this port is free, otherwise follow the terminal instructions):
```bash
http://localhost:5173
```
